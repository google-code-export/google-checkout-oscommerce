------------------------------------------------------
ONLY do this after you have done all the instructions
and followed the README.TXT and INSTALLATION.TXT.

These a just a few minor fixes and tips to make this work better.

================================


If your website is not being notified of orders placed through Google Checkout, 
you need to login to your Google merchant account, click on the Settings tab, 
go to the integration menu, and fill out the "API callback URL" text field. 
NOTE: FIRST Make sure you have TRUE SSL enabled on your site!!
This should be something like: 

https://www.yoursite.com/catalog/googlecheckout/responsehandler.php

NOTE : "www.yoursite.com" is your domain root website


================================


For proper Google integration:
Remove any word  Jakarta  from catalog/includes/spiders.txt
This is the User Agent of the google checkout bot.


================================


If no log files are updated, the problem could be that those files 
don't have the correct write persmissions (CHMOD file attributes). 
SET CHMOD Properties to 777

Files:
/catalog/googlecheckout/response_error.log
/catalog/googlecheckout/response_message.log


================================


Get rid of outputted information script on customer area screens.
This was for outputting 'running' code and not needed for final 'live' production:

File /catalog/googlecheckout/gcheckout.php:


Change:
echo '<font color="#ffffff">'.$curr_ship.'/'.$enable;
echo '</font>';

to:
//echo '<font color="#ffffff">'.$curr_ship.'/'.$enable;
//echo '</font>';



Change:
echo '<font color="#ffffff">'.$gcheck->getXml().'</font>';

To:
//echo '<font color="#ffffff">'.$gcheck->getXml().'</font>';


================================
