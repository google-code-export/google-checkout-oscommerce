Problem:
Discount coupon does not display in order subtotal during checkout 
confirmation.

Ensure the discount coupon has a unique sort order.  Set this in 
Modules > Order Total.

Problem:
"Discount Coupon" does not appear in the list of Order Total modules under 
Modules > Order Total in the admin section.

Solution:
Ensure that you have uploaded the module files contained in the contribution 
package:

Problem:
The Discount Applied order total line shows an incorrect discount amount for 
the order subtotal.  (Only happens on some orders and amount is off by no more 
than a few cents.)

Solution:
There isn't really one.  The discount is applied before tax, and OSC allows 
for multiple tax groups in each order.  This means the discount percentage 
must be applied to each line item in the order, taking into account the tax 
rate for that item.  Rounding can then cause the Discount Applied line to be a 
few cents off of the actual discount percentage for the Sub-Total line.

The discount is not actually taken from the order Sub-Total, even though it 
may appear as though it is.  If you have configured your store to display 
prices with taxes or you have configured your Discount Coupon Codes module to 
display the order Sub-total without the discount applied, then your likelihood 
of running into this situation is slightly higher.
