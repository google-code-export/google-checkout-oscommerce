Special Version joined with Discount Coupon Contribution http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,4269


Fixed Link to Manual in Coupon Admin Page  	swopedesign  	25 Sep 2006  	
After installing this contribution, my client clicked on the link to view the online help manual for this contribution from the admin page. He got a 404 error! The link is to coupons_manual.php, but the file is .html. I have changed the extension to .php for this file. This upload contains the full package for v 2.1, including reporting feature added recently.


See Doc dir for more info

Both packages are installed and merged. Just need to upgrade a flat OSC intall
