Anyone who needs to install the Google Checkout plugin on the current version of osCommerce.

== Prep work ==
These steps should be done before you begin your installation, and can be done in any order.

  * Download and install osCommerce version 2.2rc2a
    * You can get this from the [http://www.oscommerce.com/solutions/downloads osCommerce download page]
    * Instructions for how to install osCommerce are included in the osCommerce package.
  * Setup a Google Checkout Merchant Account
    * Sign up from the [https://checkout.google.com/sell/ Google Checkout Merchant page].
  * Copy down your Google Checkout Merchant ID and Merchant Key
    * These can be found under [https://checkout.google.com/sell/settings?section=Integration Settings -> Integration] in the merchant dashboard.

  # The osCommerce directory is usually the /catalog directory in the standard distribution of osCommerce. Your directory may be named differently.

=== Configure inside OS Commerce ===

  # Go to the Payment Modules section of the osCommerce admin screen and select GoogleCheckout

  # Click edit so we can fill in the values needed to start using Google Checkout. There are two modes to run under - sandbox and production.
    * The sandbox environment is for testing your integration. Orders which are sent here will not be charged but allow you to make sure your configuration worked.
    * The production environment is for sending real orders. You should change your settings for to use production once you have made sure it works with sandbox.

  # Now we need to enter some settings from Google Checkout. Checkout uses a sandbox environment for you to do your testing and to make sure everything works before going live with your store. To accept payments you need to get your merchant id and key from the production version of Google Checkout.
    * Sandbox: https://sandbox.google.com/checkout/sell/settings?section=Integration
    * Production: http://checkout.google.com/sell/settings?section=Integration
    http://google-checkout-oscommerce.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/checkout_settings.png
  # Copy the merchant ID and key for your sandbox account and your production account into the configuration screen. And hit update. 
    * Do NOT share your production key with anyone else, you should treat it like a password.
